--- abstract

This document describes an end-to-end authenticated encryption scheme for
application objects intended to be delivered over Media over QUIC Transport
(MOQT).  We reuse the SFrame scheme for authenticated encryption of media
objects, while suppressing data that would be redundant between SFrame and MOQT,
for an efficient on-the-wire representation.

# Introduction

Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) is a protocol that is optimized for the QUIC
protocol, either directly or via WebTransport, for the dissemination of delivery
of low latency media {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}. MOQT defines a
publish/subscribe media delivery layer across set of participating relays for
supporting wide range of use-cases with different resiliency and latency (live,
interactive) needs without compromising the scalability and cost effectiveness
associated with content delivery networks. It supports sending media objects
through sets of relays nodes.

Typically a MOQ Relay doesn't need to access the media content, thus allowing
the media to be "end-to-end" encrypted so that it cannot be decrypted by the
relays. However for a relay to participate effectively in the media delivery, it
needs to  access naming information of a MOQT object to carryout the required
store and forward functions.

As such, two layers of security are required:

1. Hop-by-hop (HBH) security between two MOQT relays

2. End-to-end (E2E) security from the Original Publisher of an MOQT object to End
   Subscribers

The HBH security is provided by TLS in the QUIC connection that MOQT
runs over. MOQT support different E2EE protection as well as allowing
for E2EE security.

This document defines a scheme for E2E authenticated encryption of MOQT objects.
This scheme is based on the SFrame mechanism for authenticated encryption of
media objects {{SFRAME}}.

However, a secondary goal of this design is to minimize the amount of additional
data the encryptions requires for each object. This is particularly important
for very low bit rate audio applications where the encryption overhead can
increase overall bandwidth usage by a significant percentage.  To minimize the
overhead added by end-to-end encryption, certain fields that would be redundant
between MOQT and SFrame are not transmitted.

The encryption mechanism defined in this specification can only be used
in application context where object IDs never more than 32 bits long.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
{{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

E2EE:
: End to End Encryption

HBH:
: Hop By Hop

varint:
: {{QUIC}} variable length integer, section 1.3

## Notational Conventions

This document uses the conventions detailed in ({{QUIC}} Section 1.3)
when describing the binary encoding.


### Serialized Full Track Name {#ftn}

Serialized Full Track Name is composed of MOQT Track Namespace and
Track Name as shown below:

~~~
Serialized Full Track Name = Serialize(Track Namespace) +  Serialize(Track Name)
~~~

The `Serialize` operation follows the same on-the-wire
encoding for Track Name Space and Track Name as defined in Section 2.4.1 of
{{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}.

This mandates that the serialization of Track Namespace tuples
starts with varint encoded count of tuples. This is followed by encoding
corresponding to each tuple. Each tuple's encoding starts with
varint encoded length for the count of bytes and  bytes
representing the content of the tuple.

The Track Name is varint encoded length followed by sequence of bytes that
identifies an individual track within the namespace.


The `+` represents concatenation of byte strings.


# MOQT Object Model Recap {#moqt}

MOQT defines a publish/subscribe based media delivery protocol, where in
endpoints, called original publishers, publish objects which are delivered via
participating relays to receiving endpoints, called end subscribers.

Section 2 of {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}} defines hierarchical object model for
application data, comprised of objects, groups and tracks.

Objects defines the basic data element, an addressable unit whose
payload is sequence of bytes. All objects belong to a group, indicating
ordering and potential dependencies. A track contains has collection of
groups and serves as the entity against which a subscribers issue
subscription requests.

Objects are comprised of two parts: envolope and a payload. The envelope
is never end to end encrypted and is always visible to relays. The
payload portion MAY be end to end encrypted, in which case it is only
visible to the original publisher and the end subscribers. The application is
solely responsible for the content of the object payload.

Tracks are identified by a combination of its Track Namespace and
Track Name.  Tuples of the Track Namespace and Track Name are treated
as a sequence of binary bytes.  Group and Objects are represented as
variable length integers called GroupID and ObjectID respectively.

Two important properties of objects are:

1. The combination of Track Namespace, Track Name, Group ID and Object ID are
   globally unique in a given relay network.

2. The data inside an MOQT Object (and its size) can never change after the
Object is first published. There can never be two Objects with the same
name but different data.

One of the ways system keep the Object names unique is by using a fully
qualified domain names or UUIDs as part of the TrackNamespace.

# Secure Objects

Section 10.2.1 {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}} defines fields of a canonical
MOQT Object. The protection scheme defined in this draft encrypts the
`Object Payload` and Private header extensions. The scheme authenticates
the  `Group ID`, `Object ID`, `Immutable Header Extensions`
(Section 11.2 of {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}} }} and `Object Payload` fields,
regardless of the on-the-wire encoding of the objects over QUIC Datagrams or
QUIC streams.


## Extensions

MOQT defines two types of Object Header Extensions, public (or mutable) and
immutable. This specification uses MOQT immutable extensions to convey
authenticated metadata and adds Private Object header extensions
(see {{pvt-ext}}). Private extensions are serialized and encrypted along with
the Object payload, decrypted and deserialized by the receiver. This specification
further defines `Secure Object KID` extension (see {{keyid-ext}}),
which is transmitted within the immutable extensions.

## Setup Assumptions

The application assigns each track a set of (Key ID, `track_base_key`)
tuples, where each `track_base_key` is known only to authorized original publishers
and end subscribers for a given track. How these per-track secrets are established
is outside the scope of this specification. The application also
defines which Key ID should be used for a given encryption operation.
For decryption, the Key ID is obtained from the `Secure Object KID` header
extension that is contained with in the immutable header extension of the
Object).

Applications determine the ciphersuite to be used for each
track's encryption context.  Any SFrame ciphersuite can be used.

## Application Procedure {#app}

This section provides steps for applications over MOQT to
use mechanisms defined in this specification.

### Object Encryption

To encrypt a MOQT Object, the application performs the following to
produce the plaintext input:

Call the MOQT Object's payload as `original_payload`.

`pt = Serialize(original_payload) + Serialize(Private header extensions)`

The serialization for Private header extensions follows the rules defined in
section 10.2.1.2 of {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}. The serialzation of the MOQT Object
Payload, i.e `original_payload`, has varint encoded count
of the bytes in the payload followed by the original_payload bytes.

`MOQT Object Payload = encrypt(pt)`

The output of the encrypt operation is a chiphertext which is set as
the payload for the MOQT Object, thus replacing the `original_payload`.
The length of the ciphertext now reflects the encrypted length of
`original_payload` as well as the private header extensions.

### Object Decryption

To decrypt a MOQT Object, the Object payload is provided as ciphertext input, to
obtain the plaintext. Applications deserialize the plaintext to extract
private header extensions and the application's `original_payload`.

The following deserialization steps are performed:

Let `input_payload` be the decrypted MOQT Object Payload.

1. original_payload_length = read_varint(input_payload)
2. original_payload = read_bytes(input_payload, original_payload_length)


- Read varint to obtain the `original_payload` length.

- Read `original_payload` length bytes, call it `output_payload`.

- If there exists no more data, this is the case of zero private header extensions.
  So return an empty private extension stucture by setting Type to 0xA and
  length to 0 and  MOQT Object after updating the `input_payload` and its
  length to the output_payload.

- Else, read 16 bits and if its value doesn't match 0XA, drop the incoming object, else
  parse the rest of bits as Private header extension. Finally return
  parsed private extensions and MOQT object after updating the
  `input_payload` and its length to the `output_payload`.

If parsing fails at any stage, drop the received MOQT Object.

## Encryption Schema

MOQT secure object protection relies on an SFrame cipher suite to define the
AEAD encryption algorithm and hash algorithm in use {{!RFC9605}}.  We
will refer to the following aspects of the AEAD and the hash algorithm below:

* `AEAD.Encrypt` and `AEAD.Decrypt` - The encryption and decryption functions
  for the AEAD.  We follow the convention of RFC 5116 {{!RFC5116}} and consider
  the authentication tag part of the ciphertext produced by `AEAD.Encrypt` (as
  opposed to a separate field as in SRTP {{?RFC3711}}).

* `AEAD.Nk` - The size in bytes of a key for the encryption algorithm

* `AEAD.Nn` - The size in bytes of a nonce for the encryption algorithm

* `AEAD.Nt` - The overhead in bytes of the encryption algorithm (typically the
  size of a "tag" that is added to the plaintext)

* `AEAD.Nka` - For cipher suites using the compound AEAD described in {{Section
  4.5.1 of RFC9605}}, the size in bytes of a key for the underlying encryption
  algorithm

* `Hash.Nh` - The size in bytes of the output of the hash function


## Metadata Authentication {#aad}

The Key ID, Full Track Name, Immutable Header Extensions, Group ID, and Object ID
for a given MOQT Object are authenticated as part of secure object encryption.
This ensures, for example, that encrypted objects cannot be replayed across tracks.

When protecting or unprotecting a secure object, the following data structure
captures the input to the AEAD function's AAD argument:

~~~  pseudocode
SECURE_OBJECT_AAD {
    Key ID (i),
    Group ID (i),
    Object ID (i),
    Track Namespace (..),
    Track Name Length (i),
    Track Name (..),
    Serialized Immutable Extensions (..)
}
~~~

* Track Namespace is serialized as in section 2.4.1 of MOQT.

Serialized Immutable Extensions MUST include the `Secure Object KID header
extension` containing the Key ID.

## Nonce Formation {#nonce}

The Group ID and Object ID for an object are used to form a 96-bit counter (CTR)
value, which XORed with a salt to form the nonce used in AEAD encryption.  The
counter value is formed by bitwise concatenating the  Group ID as 64 bit integer
and  Object ID as 32 bit integer. This encryption/decryption  will fail
if applied to an object where group ID is larger than 2<sup>64</sup> or
the object ID is larger than 2<sup>32</sup> and the MOQT Object MUST NOT
be processed further.

## Key Derivation {#keys}

Encryption and decryption use a key and salt derived from the `track_base_key`
associated with a Key ID. Given a `track_base_key` value, the key and salt are
derived using HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) {{!RFC5869}} as follows:

~~~ pseudocode
def derive_key_salt(key_id, track_base_key, serialized_full_track_name):
  moq_secret = HKDF-Extract("", track_base_key)
  moq_key_label = "MOQ 1.0 Secret key " + serialized_full_track_name + cipher_suite + key_id
  moq_key =
    HKDF-Expand(moq_secret, moq_key_label, AEAD.Nk)
  moq_salt_label = "MOQ 1.0 Secret salt " + serialized_full_track_name + cipher_suite + key_id
  moq_salt =
    HKDF-Expand(moq_secret, moq_salt_label, AEAD.Nn)

  return moq_key, moq_salt
~~~

In the derivation of `moq_secret`:

* The `+` operator represents concatenation of byte strings.

* The Key ID value is encoded as an 8-byte big-endian integer.

* The `cipher_suite` value is a 2-byte big-endian integer representing the
  cipher suite in use (see {{SFRAME}}).

The hash function used for HKDF is determined by the cipher suite in use.

## Encryption {#encrypt}

MOQT secure object encryption uses the AEAD encryption algorithm for the cipher
suite in use.  The key for the encryption is the `moq_key` derived
from the `track_base_key` {{keys}}.  The nonce is
formed by first XORing the `moq_salt` with the current CTR value {{nonce}}, and
then encoding the result as a big-endian integer of length `AEAD.Nn`.

The Private extensions and Object payload field from the MOQT object is used
by the AEAD algorithm for the plaintext.

The encryptor forms an SecObj header using the Key ID value provided.

The encryption procedure is as follows:

1. Obtain the plaintext payload to encrypt from the MOQT object. Extract
   the Group ID, Object ID, and the Serialized Immutable Header Extension from
   the MOQT object envelope. Ensure the Secure Object KID header extension is
   included, with the Key ID set as its value.

2. Retrieve the `moq_key` and `moq_salt` matching the Key ID.

3. Form the aad input as described in {{aad}}.

4. Form the nonce by as described in {{nonce}}.

5. Apply the AEAD encryption function with moq_key, nonce, aad,
   MOQT Object payload and serialized private header exntenions as inputs (see {{app}}).

The final SecureObject is formed from the MOQT transport headers,
followed by the output of the encryption.

## Decryption

For decrypting, the Key ID from the `Secure Object KID` header extension
contained within immutable header extension is
used to find the right key and salt for the encrypted object. The MOQT
track information matching the Key ID along with  `Group ID` and `Object ID`
fields of the MOQT object header are used to form the nonce.

The decryption procedure is as follows:

1. Parse the SecureObject to obtain Key ID, the ciphertext corresponding
   to MOQT object payload and the Group ID and Object ID from the MOQT
   object envelope.

2. Retrieve the `moq_key`, `moq_salt` and MOQT track information matching the Key ID.

3. Form the aad input as described in {{aad}}.

4. Form the nonce by as described in {{nonce}}.

5. Apply the AEAD decryption function with moq_key, nonce, aad and
   ciphertext as inputs.

6. Decode the private extension headers, returning both the headers and
   the object payload.

If extracting Key ID fails either due to missing `Secure Object KID` extension
within immutable haeader extension or error from parsing, the client MUST
discard the received MOQT Object.

If a ciphertext fails to decrypt because there is no key available for the Key ID
value presented, the client MAY buffer the ciphertext and retry decryption once
a key with that Key ID is received.  If a ciphertext fails to decrypt for any other
reason, the client MUST discard the ciphertext. Invalid ciphertexts SHOULD be
discarded in a way that is indistinguishable (to an external observer) from
having processed a valid ciphertext.  In other words, the decryption
operation should take the same amount of time regardless of whether decryption
succeeds or fails.


# Header Extensions

## Key ID Extension {#keyid-ext}

Key ID  (Extension Header Type 0x2) is a variable length integer and
identifies the keying material (keys, nonces and associated context
for the MOQT Track) to be used for a given MOQT track.

The Key ID extension is included within the Immutable Header extension.
All objects encoded MUST include the Key ID header extension when
using this specification for object encryption.

## Private Extension {#pvt-ext}

The Private Extensions (Extension Header Type 0xA) contains a sequence of
Key-Value-Pairs (see section 1.4.2 {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}) which are also
Object Extension Headers of the Object. This extension can be added by the
Original Publisher and considered part of the Object Payload.

~~~
Private Extensions {
  Type (0xA),
  Length (i),
  Key-Value-Pair (..) ...
}
~~~

# Security Considerations {#security}

The cryptographic computations described in this document are exactly those
performed in the SFrame encryption scheme defined in {{SFRAME}},
The scheme in this document is effectively a "virtualized" version of SFrame:

* The CTR value used in nonce formation is not carried in the object payload,
  but instead synthesized from the GroupID and ObjectID.

* The AAD for the AEAD operation is not sent on the wire (as with the SFrame
  Header), but constructed locally by the encrypting and decrypting endpoints.

* The format of the AAD is different:

    * The SFrame Header is constructed using QUIC-style varints, instead of the
      variable-length integer scheme defined in SFrame.

    * The GroupID and GroupID are sent directly, not as the packed CTR value.

* The `metadata` input in to SFrame operations is defined to be the
  FullTrackName value for the object.

* The labels used in key derivation reflect MOQ usage, not generic SFrame.

The security considerations discussed in the SFrame specification thus also
apply here.

The SFrame specification lists several things that an application needs to
account for in order to use SFrame securely, which are all accounted for here:

1. **Header value uniqueness:** Uniqueness of CTR values follows from the
   uniqueness of MOQT (GroupID, ObjectID) pairs. We only use one Key ID value, but
   instead use distinct SFrame contexts with distinct keys per track. This
   assures that the same (`track_base_key`, Key ID, CTR) tuple is never used twice.

2. **Key management:** We delegate this to the MOQT application, with subject to
   the assumptions described in {{setup-assumptions}}.

3. **Anti-replay:** Replay is not possible within the MOQT framework because of
   the uniqueness constraints on ObjectIDs and objects, and because the group
   ID and object ID are cryptographically bound to the secure object payload.

4. **Metadata:** The analogue of the SFrame metadata input is
   defined in {{aad}}.


Any of the SFrame ciphersuites defined in the IANA SFrame Cipher Suites registry {{CIPHERS}} can be used
to protect MOQT objects.  The caution against short tags in {{Section 7.5 of SFRAME}}
still applies here, but the MOQT environment provides some safeguards that make
it safer to use short tags, namely:

* MOQT has hop-by-hop protections provided by the underlying QUIC layer, so a
  brute-force attack could only be mounted by a relay.

* MOQT tracks have predictable object arrival rates, so a receiver can interpret
  a large deviation from this rate as a sign of an attack.

* The the binding of the secure object payload to other MOQT parameters (as
  metadata), together with MOQT's uniqueness properties ensure that a valid
  secure object payload cannot be replayed in a different context.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This document defines a new MOQT Object extension header for carrying Key ID value,
under the `MOQ Extension Headers` registry.
