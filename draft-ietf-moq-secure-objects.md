--- abstract

This document specifies an end-to-end authenticated encryption scheme for
application objects transmitted via Media over QUIC (MoQ) Transport. The scheme
enables original publishers to securely share a symmetric key with end
subscribers, ensuring that MoQ relays are unable to decrypt object contents.
Additionally, subscribers can verify the integrity and authenticity of
received objects, confirming that the content has not been modified in
transit.

# Introduction

Media Over QUIC Transport (MoQT) is a protocol that is optimized for the QUIC
protocol, either directly or via WebTransport, for the dissemination of delivery
of low latency media {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}. MoQT defines a
publish/subscribe media delivery layer across set of participating relays for
supporting wide range of use-cases with different resiliency and latency (live,
interactive) needs without compromising the scalability and cost effectiveness
associated with content delivery networks. It supports sending media objects
through sets of relays nodes.

Typically a MOQ Relay doesn't need to access the media content, thus allowing
the media to be "end-to-end" encrypted so that it cannot be decrypted by the
relays. However for a relay to participate effectively in the media delivery, it
needs to  access naming information of a MoQT object to carryout the required
store and forward functions.

As such, two layers of security are required:

1. Hop-by-hop (HBH) security between two MoQT endpoints.

2. End-to-end (E2E) security from the Original Publisher of an MoQT object to End
   Subscribers

The HBH security is provided by TLS in the QUIC connection that MoQT
runs over. MoQT support different E2EE protection as well as allowing
for E2EE security.

This document defines a scheme for E2E authenticated encryption of MoQT objects.
This scheme is based on the SFrame mechanism for authenticated encryption of
media objects {{SFRAME}}.

However, a secondary goal of this design is to minimize the amount of additional
data the encryptions requires for each object. This is particularly important
for very low bit rate audio applications where the encryption overhead can
increase overall bandwidth usage by a significant percentage.  To minimize the
overhead added by end-to-end encryption, certain fields that would be redundant
between MoQT and SFrame are not transmitted.

The encryption mechanism defined in this specification can only be used
in application context where object ID values are never more than 32 bits long.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
{{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

## Notational Conventions

### Serialized Full Track Name {#ftn}

Serialized Full Track Name is composed of MoQT Track Namespace and
Track Name as shown below:

~~~
Serialized Full Track Name = Serialize(Track Namespace)
                             + Serialize(Track Name)
~~~

The `Serialize` operation follows the same on-the-wire
encoding for Track Name Space and Track Name as defined in Section 2.4.1 of
{{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}.

This mandates that the serialization of Track Namespace tuples
starts with varint encoded count of tuples. This is followed by encoding
corresponding to each tuple. Each tuple's encoding starts with
varint encoded length for the count of bytes and  bytes
representing the content of the tuple.

The Track Name is varint encoded length followed by sequence of bytes that
identifies an individual track within the namespace.


The `+` represents concatenation of byte sequences.


# MoQT Object Model Recap {#MoQT}

MoQT defines a publish/subscribe based media delivery protocol, where in
endpoints, called original publishers, publish objects which are delivered via
participating relays to receiving endpoints, called end subscribers.

Section 2 of {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}} defines hierarchical object model for
application data, comprised of objects, groups and tracks.

Objects defines the basic data element, an addressable unit whose
payload is sequence of bytes. All objects belong to a group, indicating
ordering and potential dependencies. A track contains has collection of
groups and serves as the entity against which a subscribers issue
subscription requests.

Objects are comprised of three parts: parts that Relays can read and
modify, parts that Relay can read but is not allowed to modify, and parts
the Relays cannot read or modify. The
payload portion MAY be end to end encrypted, in which case it is only
visible to the original publisher and the end subscribers. The application is
solely responsible for the content of the object payload.

Tracks are identified by a combination of its Track Namespace and
Track Name.  Tuples of the Track Namespace and Track Name are treated
as a sequence of binary bytes.  Group and Objects are represented as
variable length integers called GroupID and ObjectID respectively.

Two important properties of objects are:

1. The combination of Track Namespace, Track Name, Group ID and Object ID are
globally unique in a given relay network, referred to as Full Object ID
in this specification.

2. The data inside an MoQT Object (and its size) can never change after the
Object is first published. There can never be two Objects with the same
Full Object ID but different data.

One of the ways system keep the Full Object IDs unique is by using a fully
qualified domain names or UUIDs as part of the Track Namespace.

# Secure Objects

Section 10.2.1 {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}} defines fields of a canonical
MoQT Object. The protection scheme defined in this draft encrypts the
`Object Payload` and Private header extensions {{pvt-ext}}.
The scheme authenticates the  `Group ID`, `Object ID`,
`Immutable Header Extensions` (Section 11.2 of {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}} }}
and `Object Payload` fields, regardless of the on-the-wire encoding of the
objects over QUIC Datagrams or QUIC streams.

## Extensions

MoQT defines two types of Object Header Extensions, mutable and
immutable. This specification uses MoQT immutable extensions to convey
end-to-end authenticated metadata and adds Private Object header extensions
(see {{pvt-ext}}). Private extensions are serialized and encrypted along with
the Object payload, decrypted and deserialized by the receiver. This specification
further defines `Secure Object KID` extension (see {{keyid-ext}}),
which is transmitted within the immutable extensions.

## Setup Assumptions

The application assigns each track a set of (Key ID, `track_base_key`)
tuples, where each `track_base_key` is known only to authorized original publishers
and end subscribers for a given track. How these per-track secrets and
their lifetimes are established is outside the scope of this specification.
The application also defines which Key ID should be used for a given encryption
operation. For decryption, the Key ID is obtained from the `Secure Object KID`
header extension (that is contained with in the immutable header extension of the
Object).

Applications determine the ciphersuite to be used for each
track's encryption context.  See {{ciphersuite}} for the list
of ciphersuites that can be used.

## Application Procedure {#app}

This section provides steps for applications over MoQT to
use mechanisms defined in this specification.

### Object Encryption

To encrypt a MoQT Object, the application constructs a plaintext
from the application data and any private header extensions:

~~~
pt = Serialize(original_payload)
     + Serialize(Private header extensions)
~~~

Where `original_payload` is the application's object data. The
serialization of `original_payload` consists of a varint-encoded
byte count followed by the payload bytes. The serialization for
private header extensions follows the rules for immutable extensions
(as defined in section 11 of {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}).

The plaintext is then encrypted:

~~~
ciphertext = encrypt(pt)
~~~

The resulting ciphertext replaces the `original_payload` as the
MoQT Object Payload. The ciphertext length reflects the encrypted
`original_payload` plus any private header extensions plus the
AEAD authentication tag.

{: #fig-encryption-process title="Object Encryption Process" }

### Object Decryption

To decrypt a MoQT Object, the application provides the MoQT Object
Payload as ciphertext input to obtain the plaintext:

~~~
pt = decrypt(ciphertext)
~~~

The plaintext is then deserialized to extract the application's
`original_payload` and any private header extensions:

1. Read a varint to obtain the `original_payload` length.

2. Read that many bytes as `original_payload`.

3. If no bytes remain, there are no private header extensions.

4. Otherwise, read the extension type (16 bits). If the value
   is not 0xA, drop the object. Parse the remaining bytes as
   the Private header extension structure.

If parsing fails at any stage, the receiver MUST drop the MoQT Object.

{: #fig-decryption-process title="Object Decryption Process" }

## Encryption Schema

MoQT secure object protection relies on an ciphersute to define the
AEAD encryption algorithm and hash algorithm in use ({{ciphersuite}}).  We
will refer to the following aspects of the AEAD and the hash algorithm below:

* `AEAD.Encrypt` and `AEAD.Decrypt` - The encryption and decryption functions
  for the AEAD.  We follow the convention of RFC 5116 {{!RFC5116}} and consider
  the authentication tag part of the ciphertext produced by `AEAD.Encrypt` (as
  opposed to a separate field as in SRTP {{?RFC3711}}).

* `AEAD.Nk` - The size in bytes of a key for the encryption algorithm

* `AEAD.Nn` - The size in bytes of a nonce for the encryption algorithm

* `AEAD.Nt` - The overhead in bytes of the encryption algorithm (typically the
  size of a "tag" that is added to the plaintext)

* `AEAD.Nka` - For cipher suites using the compound AEAD described in (Section 4.5.1 of {{SFRAME}}), the size in bytes of a key for the underlying encryption
  algorithm

* `Hash.Nh` - The size in bytes of the output of the hash function


## Metadata Authentication {#aad}

The Key ID, Full Track Name, Immutable Header Extensions, Group ID, and Object ID
for a given MoQT Object are authenticated as part of secure object encryption.
This ensures, for example, that encrypted objects cannot be replayed across tracks.

When protecting or unprotecting a secure object, the following data structure
captures the input to the AEAD function's AAD argument:

~~~  pseudocode
SECURE_OBJECT_AAD {
    Key ID (i),
    Group ID (i),
    Object ID (i),
    Track Namespace (..),
    Track Name Length (i),
    Track Name (..),
    Serialized Immutable Extensions (..)
}
~~~

* Track Namespace is serialized as in section 2.4.1 of MoQT.

Serialized Immutable Extensions MUST include the `Secure Object KID header
extension` containing the Key ID.

## Nonce Formation {#nonce}

The Group ID and Object ID for an object are used to form a 96-bit counter (CTR)
value, which XORed with a salt to form the nonce used in AEAD encryption.  The
counter value is formed by bitwise concatenating the  Group ID as 64 bit integer
and  Object ID as 32 bit integer. This encryption/decryption  will fail
if applied to an object where group ID is larger than 2<sup>64</sup> or
the object ID is larger than 2<sup>32</sup> and the MoQT Object MUST NOT
be processed further.

## Key Derivation {#keys}

Encryption and decryption use a key and salt derived from the `track_base_key`
associated with a Key ID. Given a `track_base_key` value, the key and salt are
derived using HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) {{!RFC5869}} as follows:

~~~ pseudocode
def derive_key_salt(key_id,track_base_key,
                    serialized_full_track_name):
  moq_secret = HKDF-Extract("", track_base_key)
  moq_key_label = "MOQ 1.0 Secure Objects Secret key "
                + serialized_full_track_name
                + cipher_suite + key_id
  moq_key =
    HKDF-Expand(moq_secret, moq_key_label, AEAD.Nk)
  moq_salt_label = "MOQ 1.0 Secret salt "
                 + serialized_full_track_name
                 + cipher_suite + key_id
  moq_salt =
    HKDF-Expand(moq_secret, moq_salt_label, AEAD.Nn)

  return moq_key, moq_salt
~~~

In the derivation of `moq_secret`:

* The `+` operator represents concatenation of byte strings.

* The Key ID value is encoded as an 8-byte big-endian integer.

* The `cipher_suite` value is a 2-byte big-endian integer representing the
  cipher suite in use (see {{SFRAME}}).

The hash function used for HKDF is determined by the cipher suite in use.

## Encryption {#encrypt}

MoQT secure object encryption uses the AEAD encryption algorithm for the cipher
suite in use.  The key for the encryption is the `moq_key` derived
from the `track_base_key` {{keys}}.  The nonce is
formed by first XORing the `moq_salt` with the current CTR value {{nonce}}, and
then encoding the result as a big-endian integer of length `AEAD.Nn`.

The Private extensions and Object payload field from the MoQT object is used
by the AEAD algorithm for the plaintext.

The encryptor forms an SecObj header using the Key ID value provided.

The encryption procedure is as follows:

1. Obtain the plaintext payload to encrypt from the MoQT object. Extract
   the Group ID, Object ID, and the Serialized Immutable Header Extension from
   the MoQT object headers. Ensure the Secure Object KID header extension is
   included, with the Key ID set as its value.

2. Retrieve the `moq_key` and `moq_salt` matching the Key ID.

3. Form the aad input as described in {{aad}}.

4. Form the nonce by as described in {{nonce}}.

5. Apply the AEAD encryption function with moq_key, nonce, aad,
   MoQT Object payload and serialized private header exntenions as inputs (see {{app}}).

The final SecureObject is formed from the MoQT transport headers,
followed by the output of the encryption.

## Decryption

For decrypting, the Key ID from the `Secure Object KID` header extension
contained within immutable header extension is
used to find the right key and salt for the encrypted object. The MoQT
track information matching the Key ID along with  `Group ID` and `Object ID`
fields of the MoQT object header are used to form the nonce.

The decryption procedure is as follows:

1. Parse the SecureObject to obtain Key ID, the ciphertext corresponding
   to MoQT object payload and the Group ID and Object ID from the MoQT
   object headers.

2. Retrieve the `moq_key`, `moq_salt` and MoQT track information matching the Key ID.

3. Form the aad input as described in {{aad}}.

4. Form the nonce by as described in {{nonce}}.

5. Apply the AEAD decryption function with moq_key, nonce, aad and
   ciphertext as inputs.

6. Decode the private extension headers, returning both the headers and
   the object payload.

If extracting Key ID fails either due to missing `Secure Object KID` extension
within immutable haeader extension or error from parsing, the client MUST
discard the received MoQT Object.

If a ciphertext fails to decrypt because there is no key available for the Key ID
value presented, the client MAY buffer the ciphertext and retry decryption once
a key with that Key ID is received.  If a ciphertext fails to decrypt for any other
reason, the client MUST discard the ciphertext. Invalid ciphertexts SHOULD be
discarded in a way that is indistinguishable (to an external observer) from
having processed a valid ciphertext.  In other words, the decryption
operation should take the same amount of time regardless of whether decryption
succeeds or fails.


# Header Extensions

## Key ID Extension {#keyid-ext}

Key ID  (Extension Header Type 0x2) is a variable length integer and
identifies the keying material (keys, nonces and associated context
for the MoQT Track) to be used for a given MoQT track.

The Key ID extension is included within the Immutable Header extension.
All objects encoded MUST include the Key ID header extension when
using this specification for object encryption.

## Private Extension {#pvt-ext}

The Private Extensions (Extension Header Type 0xA) contains a sequence of
Key-Value-Pairs (see section 1.4.2 {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}) which are also
Object Extension Headers of the Object. This extension can be added by the
Original Publisher and considered part of the Object Payload.

~~~
Private Extensions {
  Type (0xA),
  Length (i),
  Key-Value-Pair (..) ...
}

# Usage Considerations

To implement the protection mechanisms specified herein, a secure object requires
the complete object before any validity checks can be performed. This introduces latency proportional to the object size; if the application aggregates excessive data into a single object (e.g., encapsulating 6 seconds of video), the entire segment must be received before processing or validation can commence, delaying access to all contained data until transfer completion.


# Security Considerations {#security}

The cryptographic computations described in this document are exactly those
performed in the SFrame encryption scheme defined in {{SFRAME}},
The scheme in this document is effectively a "virtualized" version of SFrame:

* The CTR value used in nonce formation is not carried in the object payload,
  but instead synthesized from the GroupID and ObjectID.

* The AAD for the AEAD operation is not sent on the wire (as with the SFrame
  Header), but constructed locally by the encrypting and decrypting endpoints.

* The format of the AAD is different:

    * The SFrame Header is constructed using MoQT-style varints, instead of the
      variable-length integer scheme defined in SFrame.

    * The GroupID and GroupID are sent directly, not as the packed CTR value.

* The `metadata` input in to SFrame operations is defined to be the
  FullTrackName value for the object.

* The labels used in key derivation reflect MOQ usage, not generic SFrame.

The security considerations discussed in the SFrame specification thus also
apply here.

The SFrame specification lists several things that an application needs to
account for in order to use SFrame securely, which are all accounted for here:

1. **Header value uniqueness:** Uniqueness of CTR values follows from the
   uniqueness of MoQT (GroupID, ObjectID) pairs. We only use one Key ID value, but
   instead use distinct SFrame contexts with distinct keys per track. This
   assures that the same (`track_base_key`, Key ID, CTR) tuple is never used twice.

2. **Key management:** We delegate this to the MoQT application, with subject to
   the assumptions described in {{setup-assumptions}}.

3. **Anti-replay:** Replay is not possible within the MoQT framework because of
   the uniqueness constraints on ObjectIDs and objects, and because the group
   ID and object ID are cryptographically bound to the secure object payload.

4. **Metadata:** The analogue of the SFrame metadata input is
   defined in {{aad}}.

Any of the SFrame ciphersuites defined in the IANA SFrame Cipher Suites
registry {{CIPHERS}} can be used
to protect MoQT objects.  The caution against short tags in {{Section 7.5 of SFRAME}}
still applies here, but the MoQT environment provides some safeguards that make
it safer to use short tags, namely:

* MoQT has hop-by-hop protections provided by the underlying QUIC layer, so a
  brute-force attack could only be mounted by a relay.

* In some usecases MoQT tracks have predictable object arrival rates, so a receiver can interpret
  a large deviation from this rate as a sign of an attack.

* The the binding of the secure object payload to other MoQT parameters (as
  metadata), together with MoQT's uniqueness properties ensure that a valid
  secure object payload cannot be replayed in a different context.

## AEAD Invocation Limits

AEAD algorithms have limits on how many times a single key can be used
before the cryptographic guarantees begin to degrade. Exceeding these
limits can compromise confidentiality (allowing an attacker to
distinguish encrypted content from random data) or integrity (allowing
an attacker to forge valid ciphertexts). The severity of these risks
depends on the specific algorithm in use.

Implementations MUST track the number of encryption and decryption
operations performed with each `moq_key` and ensure that these counts
remain within the limits specified in {{AEAD-LIMITS}} for the cipher
suite in use. When approaching these limits, implementations MUST
arrange for new keying material to be established (e.g., by rotating
to a new Key ID with a fresh `track_base_key`) before the limits are
exceeded.

For the AES-GCM cipher suites defined in this document, the primary
concern is the confidentiality limit, which restricts the number of
encryptions performed with a single key. For AES-CTR-HMAC cipher
suites, both encryption and decryption operations count toward the
applicable limits.

## Detecting Deletion by Malicious Relays {#deletion-detection}

A malicious relay could selectively delete objects or groups before forwarding
them to subscribers. While this specification does not mandate detection of such
deletions, it does provide mechanisms that applications can use to detect when
content has been removed.

Some applications may not require deletion detection, or may be able to detect
missing data based on the internal structure of the object payload (e.g.,
sequence numbers embedded in the media format). For applications that do require
deletion detection at the MoQT layer, the following approaches are available:

### Monotonically Incrementing Identifiers

Applications that assign Group IDs and Object IDs in a strictly monotonic
sequence (incrementing by 1 for each successive group or object) can
straightforwardly detect gaps. A subscriber receiving Group ID N followed by
Group ID N+2, or Object ID M followed by Object ID M+3, can conclude that
intervening content was not delivered.

### Non-Sequential Identifiers with Gap Extensions

Applications that use Group IDs or Object IDs with intentional gaps (e.g., for
sparse data or timestamp-based identifiers) MUST include the Group ID Gap
and/or Object ID Gap extensions as immutable header extensions. These extensions
indicate the expected distance to the next identifier. If the Object ID Gap
extension is absent from a secure object, receivers MUST assume a gap value
of 1. Similarly, if the Group ID Gap extension is absent, receivers MUST assume
a gap value of 1.

## Signaling End of Content

For applications that need to reliably detect lost objects at the end of a
subgroup, group, or track, it is RECOMMENDED to signal completion using object
status values defined in {{MoQ-TRANSPORT}}. By explicitly marking the final
object in a sequence, subscribers can distinguish between "more objects may
arrive" and "all objects have been sent," enabling detection of trailing
deletions that would otherwise be undetectable.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

## MOQ Extension Headers Registry

This document defines new MoQT Object extension headers under the
`MOQ Extension Headers` registry.

| Type |                         Value                        |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x2  | Secure Object KID - see {{keyid-ext}}                |
| 0xA  | Private Extensions - see {{pvt-ext}}                 |

## Cipher Suites {#ciphersuite}

This document establishes a "MoQ Secure Objects Cipher Suites" registry.
Each cipher suite specifies an AEAD encryption algorithm and a hash
algorithm used for key derivation.

The following values are defined for each cipher suite:

* `Nh`: The size in bytes of the hash function output
* `Nka`: The size in bytes of the encryption key for the underlying cipher (CTR suites only)
* `Nk`: The size in bytes of the AEAD key
* `Nn`: The size in bytes of the AEAD nonce
* `Nt`: The size in bytes of the AEAD authentication tag

| Value  | Name                       | R | Nh | Nka | Nk | Nn | Nt |
| ------ | -------------------------- | - | -- | --- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0x0000 | Reserved                   | - |    |     |    |    |    |
| 0x0001 | AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_80 | Y | 32 | 16  | 48 | 12 | 10 |
| 0x0002 | AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_64 | Y | 32 | 16  | 48 | 12 | 8  |
| 0x0003 | AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_32 | N | 32 | 16  | 48 | 12 | 4  |
| 0x0004 | AES_128_GCM_SHA256_128     | Y | 32 | n/a | 16 | 12 | 16 |
| 0x0005 | AES_256_GCM_SHA512_128     | Y | 64 | n/a | 32 | 12 | 16 |
| 0xF000-0xFFFF | Reserved for private use | - |  |     |    |    |    |

The "R" column indicates whether the cipher suite is Recommended:

* Y: Indicates that the IETF has consensus that the item is
     RECOMMENDED. Requries Standard Action as defined {{!RFC8126}}.

* N: Indicates the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of
     the associated mechanism. Requires First Come First Serve as
     defined in {{!RFC8126}}.

* D: Indicates that the item is discouraged and SHOULD NOT be
     used. Requirest Standard Action or IESG Approval as defined in
     {{!RFC8126}}.


Cipher suite values are 2-byte big-endian integers.

**AES-GCM cipher suites** (0x0004, 0x0005) use AES-GCM for authenticated
encryption with a full 128-bit authentication tag.

**AES-CTR-HMAC cipher suites** (0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0003) use AES in counter
mode combined with HMAC for authentication in an encrypt-then-MAC
construction. These suites support truncated authentication tags,
providing lower overhead at the cost of reduced forgery resistance.

Implementations MUST support `AES_128_GCM_SHA256_128` (0x0004).
Implementations SHOULD support `AES_128_CTR_HMAC_SHA256_80` (0x0001).
